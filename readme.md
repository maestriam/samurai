# 🔴 Maestriam/Samurai

**Maestriam/Samurai** is a simple package for creating and managing themes for Laravel applications, using [component](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade#components-and-slots) and [include](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade#including-sub-views) functions of Laravel Blade.  
You can publishing your themes and install-it in another projects using composer.

composer require maestriam/samurai
```

**Publish samurai.php into config folder**

``` bash

```

**Creating a new include**   
``` bash
php artisan samurai:make-include my-include my-vendor/my-theme 
```

php artisan samurai:use my-vendor/my-theme
```

**Using components into blade files**

```
