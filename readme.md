# üî¥ Maestriam/Samurai

**Maestriam/Samurai** is a simple package for creating and managing themes for Laravel applications, using [component](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade#components-and-slots) and [include](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade#including-sub-views) functions of Laravel Blade.  
You can publishing your themes and install-it in another projects using composer.
